GeneticProgrammingCoevolutionLib
================================

A general library in Java for genetic programming. Includes features such as spatial/non-spatial coevolution. Implements GPTrees as generally as possible. For now, GPTree Nodes always return Integers for simplicity. May expand to have &quot;strongly typed GP Trees&quot;.
