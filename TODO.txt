-Data output
	X Header from static GPConfig class (because it's global data)
		*Changed this to be from population class. 
		*Includes info such as best fitness
	X "short" output from Population class
		*made this data about each creature in final generation
	- Size of best tree for each generation (no. of nodes) 
	- "long" output (possibly List<String>, one for each creature)

-GPCreature
	X Crossover, decided it's governed by the creature class. 
	- Mutate...optional
	- Start on minichess! 

-GPPopulation
	- SpatialGamePop //With creatures that play one-on-one games
	- NonSpatialGamePop  
	X SpatialTournyPop
	X NonSpatialTournyPop

	- Parasites for function approximation (test cases)

Save library in JAR file, create a new repo for
application to minichess. Much cleaner this way.
